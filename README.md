# Digi Showcase
### Display Joomla! content arranged in a dynamic showcase.

Create a beautiful dynamic showcase with Joomla content and reduce the bounce rate on your website by showing to visitors the featured content.

You can create **responsive grid with Joomla articles**, a **Joomla slideshow**, a **Joomla timeline**, a **Joomla tag cloud**, a **Joomla masonry layout**. The choice is yours!

You can place the featured content in any module position available in your template to help users to find immediately what they are looking for.

With just few clicks, you can set up Digi Showcase to organize Joomla articles or other contents, styled in a professional way.

Use Joomla Articles, Joomla Categories, Joomla Tags or a Custom CSV as data sources to populate the module.

Use custom text in CSV format as data source to show the content as you wish, properly formatted, in the module. A expressly created special window next to the text area, can help you to format the content correctly in CSV format, suggesting which data you have to enter.

If Joomla articles are not enough, you can expand Digi Showcase with its Expansion Packs, to use other third-party components as data source.
